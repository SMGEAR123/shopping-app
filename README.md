# shopping-app
*A simple grocery shopping application for roommates*

* *Currently in the planning phase for this new project* *

**Goals**
To create an app that lets users list items they need in case other group users happen to be able to pick them up.

**Features**
- Create a list of items for a shopping list that users can modify
- Create an item history list for users to refer to rather than re-adding items
- Create an account system for users to add their "Household"
- Items retrieved from an API

Extra:
Users can create a custom recipe that automatically adds all items to the list.

*Item Schema* - What should each item object look like?
Item Name: string
Description: string
Link: string
Notes: string
LastOrdered:string

*Concepts and Designs*
Item Submission Form

Here's what I'm planning to use!

* Angular | Framework
* Firebase | Database
* An API for recipes (Currently researching)
* Firebase |  Hosting
* Angular Material | Framework
